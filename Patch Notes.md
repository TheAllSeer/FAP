### PATCH NOTES MOTHERFUCKER


# V1.0:

## Home Page

the homepage shows financial summary, which contains gold spent on each material, earned gold after tax and net profit. 
and the production stats, which would be the potions from fished materials and potions from bought materials. 
it also includes avg cost per fish and price per potion.

## Transactions
there are four transaction types: buying fish, catching fish, buying kelp and selling potions. 

you can enter quantity, and the cost/price per unit. the defaults are :
kelp - 4g
fish - 10g
potion - 44g

once you add a transaction, it gets logged into the transactions tab. 
a transaction can be deleted by click & holding it. you will be prompted with a confirmation window.

## Stock
this shows the volatility of the net gain/losses of the FAP stock over time.
